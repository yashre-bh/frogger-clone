# Frogger

Hosted [**here**](https://yashre-bh.github.io/frogger-clone/).

The premise of the game is to help the frog safely cross the busy road and the river. The frog needs to avoid crashing with the moving cars, or drowning into the river.

Use the `Up Arrow`, `Down Arrow`, `Left Arrow` and `Right Arrow` keys to navigate through the canvas. 
The `Space Bar` can be used as a toggle to pause and play the game.

The game employs sprite sheet animation, sounds, and `localStorage` for keeping track of the High Score.
